<h1>Privacy Policy for LOKEY Password Vault</h1>

<p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

<p>LOKEY Password Vault (“the App”) is designed to securely store your credentials locally on your device. 
We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personal data or passwords you save in the App.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information, credentials, analytics data, or usage statistics. 
All data remains on your device and is fully under your control.</p>

<h2>2. Local-Only Data Storage</h2>
<p>All credentials and notes you save are stored locally and securely on your device using Apple’s Keychain encryption. 
None of this data leaves your device.</p>

<h2>3. Device Security & Biometrics</h2>
<p>The App may use biometric authentication (Face ID or Touch ID) to unlock access. 
This authentication is handled entirely by Apple’s Secure Enclave. 
We do not have access to your biometric data.</p>

<h2>4. No Third-Party Integrations</h2>
<p>The App does not use third-party analytics, tracking services, advertising networks, or external servers.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because the App does not collect or store personal data outside your device, you retain full control of all information. 
You may delete the App at any time to permanently remove all stored data.</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us at:</p>
<p><strong>devindesilva07@gmail.com</strong></p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App. 
Updates will be available on the App Store listing.</p>
